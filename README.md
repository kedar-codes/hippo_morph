# hippo_morph
Current code for my hippocampal morphometry workflow, based on the hippodeep_pytorch segmentation program and the SlicerSALT shape analysis software.

Requires hippodeep_pytorch (located here: https://github.com/bthyreau/hippodeep_pytorch) and SlicerSALT (located here: https://salt.slicer.org/). Disclaimer: I am not affiliated in anyway with the developers of these programs, nor does my code represent any official additions/modifications to the original programs.
